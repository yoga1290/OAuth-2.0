This is actually parts of my current [Google AppEngine](http://yoga1290.appspot.com/printk/index.html)â€¦

I'm using basic URL Connections to implement the OAuth 2.0 Client/App-side.. My AppEngine runs under Java but hopefully, you can port it to favorite language since URL Connection or Sockets must be widely supported in many programming languages in many modern devices!

More updates soon,stay tune!

& Sure,Feel free to like or "Stargaze" or report issues/feedbacks! :D!
